# EAI Hub (starter)

This folder is the **Hub** orchestration layer: intake → route → run → deliver.

In this starter bundle it is a *skeleton* meant to be wired to:
- `packages/ssot` (rules + parser + rubrics)
- connector implementations in `src/connectors/`
- a UI in `apps/studio-ui` or `apps/learn-runtime`

See top-level README for the source mapping and how each imported zip is used.
